# Ucumate

Ucumate is a developer-friendly Java library for parsing, validating, canonicalizing, and converting units of measure 
based on the [Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM)](https://ucum.org/) standard. It provides validation, canonicalization, and
conversion support with high decimal precision if desired. Furthermore, all *special units* are supported. 

TODO maven dependency

If you need high precision (especially when special units are involved) then you should use the [ucumate-core-exact-special-math module](exact_math.md).

todo maven special math dependency

If you need data persistence across restarts you can use the [ucumate-persistence](persistence.md) module.
